  <p class="col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-3 col-xs-4 text-success pt">School canteen facility aims to provide children of working parents to buy nutritious and healthy food at competitive prices during the school day. Meals are either cooked on the premises or bought from approved restaurants and food outlets. Pupils who cannot take full breakfast from home may bring some form of healthy ‘snack’ with them for break time. Pupils can also buy snacks items and fruits from the snacks counter.

    Parents shall send canteen food order slip or coupon through the pupil for availing canteen services.  Payments can be made daily, weekly or monthly. There is a choice of menu that operates on a rota basis during the week. If you would like to learn more about the menu and payment system, please contact the Catering Supervisor.
    
    Parents are requested to consider healthy food options with quantity appropriate to the age and appetite of the student.  Pupils are encouraged to bring and use fork and spoon for their lunch. Parents are advised to send packed lunches covered with a towel.
    Pupils may bring water to drink during the day in a clean water bottle. Water dispensers are provided for them to refill their bottles during the day.</p>

    <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive">
    <p class="col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-3 col-xs-4 text-warning pt">In entertainment and commercial settings, attendance is often measured to determine the success of an event as a form of entertainment. Attendance at sporting events is particularly well examined, as sports teams with attendance too low to generate revenue may be shut down or relocated. "Attendance figures, average attendance, and percentage of stadium capacity filled are important indicators of fan support and how much advertisers and partners are willing to invest in a team".[2] Attendance of other events, such as films, plays, and other performances, may similarly determine whether the production was a commercial success, and may influence the determination to make sequels or similar works. The expectation of certain levels of attendance at a particular kind of event is a significant factor in determining the seating capacity to be built into venues constructed for such events, and the distribution of events or performances.[3] If an event repeats, as with a series of games in a sports season or performances of a concert or show, "the aim though should be to spread attendance across less popular days, or extend performances over a longer period of time".</p>
